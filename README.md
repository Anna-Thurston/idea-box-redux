# IdeaBox Redux

by Noah Gibson, Annie Goodwin, and Colin Koga

## Introduction

IdeaBox is project designed to continue to develope skills using localStorage, data- attributes, arrays and gain an understanding of how to use seperate data models and DOM manipulation.  Trying to incorporate all of these goals through event delegation using data- attributes proved challenging.  Using JSON for localStorage whether stringigy or parse helped in learning about the interactions between two .js files. We were tasked with building out a given comp and designing and writing the functionality accordingly.
